The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down.

The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

Each turn:

The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol. The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol. If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over. If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched. The star rating is based as follows:

★ ★ ★ Complete with 24 moves or less

★ ★ Complete with less than 32 moves

★ Complete with 31 moves or more

Once all cards are matched, a popup message appears and shows your star ratings, time taken, and how many moves it took to finish the game.
